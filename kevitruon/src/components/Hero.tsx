              To further hone my skills and prepare for a career in software
              engineering, I recently graduated from Hack Reactor's Advanced
              Coding Bootcamp. This program provided me with real-world training
              in Full-Stack web development using cutting-edge technologies and
              frameworks. Through projects and immersive learning experiences, I
              became proficient in tools like React, Redux, Express, PostgreSQL,
              and modern development workflows. Hack Reactor's intensive program
              allowed me to translate my theoretical knowledge into practical
              real-world applications, enabling me to hit the ground running and
              deliver user-friendly software solutions.
